# Create a function to evaluate player's guesses
    # Reponse if the guess is correct (the higher user count)
    # Reponse if the guess is wrong (the lower user count)
    # Reponse if the guess is not one of the two options

      
# Create a function with game logic
    # Instantiate variable to keep game running (while loop)
    # Instantiate variable for tracking number of correct guesses (Score)
    # Instantiate variable for storing the user count of the choice guessed

    # Choose a pair of options to be compared at random using random choice

    # Begin while loop:    
        # Prompt user for next guess

        # Evaluate guess (function call)
            # If correct, increment Score up
            # If wrong, break loop
            
    # Prompt user whether or not he would like to play again
        # If yes, call function
        # If no, print farewell message


# Call function with game logic to launch game
