# Describe Problem
def my_function():
    for i in range(1, 20):
        if i == 20:
            print("You got it")

my_function()

# Problem: The print statement is never triggered because range never reaches 
# Fix: Increase range to (1, 21)


# Reproduce the Bug
from random import randint
dice_imgs = ["❶", "❷", "❸", "❹", "❺", "❻"]
dice_num = randint(1, 6)
print(dice_imgs[dice_num])

# Problem: dice_imgs[6] is out of range
# Fix: Decrease range to randint(0, 5)

# The problem can be reproduced with "dice_num = 6"


# Play Computer
year = int(input("What's your year of birth?"))
if year > 1980 and year < 1994:
  print("You are a millenial.")
elif year > 1994:
  print("You are a Gen Z.")

# Problem: Entering "1994" returns nothing
# Fix: Correct the comparison operators to include 1994 in one of the choices


# Fix the Errors
age = input("How old are you?")
if age > 18:
    print("You can drive at age {age}.")

# Problem: TypeError: '>' not supported between instances of 'str' and 'int'
# Fix: convert the age input to an integer with "int(input("How old are you?"))"

# Problem: Output does not insert age into output statement
# Fix: Change print statement to an f-string.  "print(f"You can drive at age {age}.")"


# Print is Your Friend
pages = 0
word_per_page = 0
pages = int(input("Number of pages: "))
word_per_page == int(input("Number of words per page: "))
total_words = pages * word_per_page
print(f"pages = {pages}")
print(f"word_per_page = {word_per_page}")
print(total_words)

# Problem: Output does not display product of pages and word_per_page
# Fix: Change the "==" sign into a "=" sign to evaluate word_per_page
# "word_per_page = int(input("Number of words per page: "))"

def mutate(a_list):
    b_list = []

        new_item = item * 2
    b_list.append(new_item)
    print(b_list)

mutate([1,2,3,5,8,13])

# Problem: mutate function returns a list with a single value (26)
# Fix: indent the line with "append" to include all values from a_list in b_list
