Code Challenge: Paint Area Calculator

Created on Fri Nov  9 13:18:41 2024
"""

"""
You are painting a wall.  The instructions of the paint can says that 1 can of
paint can cover 5 square meters of wall.  Given a random height and width of 
wall, calculate how many cans of paint you'll need to buy.

number of cans = (wall height x wall width) / coverage per can

e.g. Height = 2, Width = 4, Coverage = 5

number of cans = (2 x 4) / 5

But because youcan't buy 0.6 of a can of paint, the result should be rounded 
up to 2 cans.

import math

def paint_calc(height, width, cover):
    area = height * width
    amount = math.ceil(area / cover)    # Ceiling NOT round
    print(f"You need to purchase {amount} cans of paint.")


# Don't change the code below
test_h = int(input("Height of wall: "))
test_w = int(input("Width of wall: "))
coverage = 5
paint_calc(height=test_h, width=test_w, cover=coverage)
