#Number Guessing Game Objectives:

# Include an ASCII art logo.
# Allow the player to submit a guess for a number between 1 and 100.
# Check user's guess against actual answer. Print "Too high." or "Too low." depending on the user's answer. 
# If they got the answer correct, show the actual answer to the player.
# Track the number of turns remaining.
# If they run out of turns, provide feedback to the player. 
# Include two different difficulty levels (e.g., 10 guesses in easy mode, only 5 guesses in hard mode).


# Import random module for choosing a number
import random
# Import logo from a file with asci art
from number_guessing_art import logo

# Instantiate constants for number of turns for each game mode
EASY_MODE_TURNS = 10
DIFFICULT_MODE_TURNS = 5

# Create a function that allows players to choose the game's difficulty level
    # return the number of guesses permitted in a game
def difficulty_mode():
    print("A random number has been chosen from 1 - 100.")
    print("Your objective is to correctly guess the number.")
    print("\n")

    if input("Choose your difficulty setting: Would you like game to be Easy or Difficult? ").lower == 'easy':
        print("You will have 10 chances to guess the correct number.  Good Luck!")
        return EASY_MODE_TURNS
    else:
        print("You will have only 5 chances to guess the correct number.  Good Luck!")
        return DIFFICULT_MODE_TURNS

# Create a function to evaluate player's guesses
    # Reponse if the guess is higher than the target number
    # Reponse if the guess is lower than the target number
    # Reponse if the guess is target number (Victory condition)


# Create a function with game logic called number_guessing_game
    # Instantiate variable for While Loop called continue_playing
    
    # Instantiate variable for tracking number of guesses
    # Instantiate variable for storing the number to be guessed
    
    # Choose a number at random to be guessed using random choice
    
    # Display introductory text (Welcome and rules)
    
    # Begin while loop:
        # Show user number of guesses remaining
        # Prompt user for next guess
        # Evaluate guess (high, low, or correct)
        # Check how many turns are remaining
            # If there are guesses left continue with message
            # If there are NOT guesses remaining display failure message

    # Ask user if he wants to play again


# Call function with game logic to launch game
