#Number Guessing Game Objectives:

# Include an ASCII art logo.
# Allow the player to submit a guess for a number between 1 and 100.
# Check user's guess against actual answer. Print "Too high." or "Too low." depending on the user's answer. 
# If they got the answer correct, show the actual answer to the player.
# Track the number of turns remaining.
# If they run out of turns, provide feedback to the player. 
# Include two different difficulty levels (e.g., 10 guesses in easy mode, only 5 guesses in hard mode).


# Import random module for choosing a number
# Import logo from a file with asci art

# Instantiate constants for number of turns for each game mode

# Create a function to evaluate player's guesses
    # Reponse if the guess is higher than the target number
    # Reponse if the guess is lower than the target number
    # Reponse if the guess is target number (Victory condition)


# Create a function with game logic called number_guessing_game
    # Instantiate variable for While Loop called continue_playing
    
    # Instantiate variable for tracking number of guesses
    # Instantiate variable for storing the number to be guessed
    
    # Choose a number at random to be guessed using random choice
    
    # Begin while loop:
        # Show user number of guesses remaining
        # Prompt user for next guess
        # Evaluate guess (high, low, or correct)
            # If guess correct, display victory message
            # If guess incorrect: 
                # If there are guesses remaining, display response
                # If there are NOT guesses remaining, break loop
                
    # End game with failure message
    # Ask user if he wants to play again


# Call function with game logic to launch game
